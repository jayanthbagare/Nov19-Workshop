# What is a System ? #
	1. Open and Closed Systems 
	2. Figure out factors for Homeostasis (Tendency of a System to be resilient to external disruptions)
	3. Adaptation (How does the system adapt to external changes) 
	4. Throughput (what is the rate of consumption of the system) 
	5. Studying the system as Eulerian/Lagrangian
# What is a Model ? #
	1. Model and Real World
	2. Define Personas
	3. Define Process Flows
	4. Define Time maps
	5. Identify Bottlenecks
	6. Define Causal Loops
	7. Stocks and Flows 
		7.1 Data Velocity
	8. Initial Conditions of the Model
	9. How will the model Die
# What are Conditions ? #
	1. Compute, Network, Storage Optimization
	2.  Data Velocity Again
	3. Cost Conditions
	4. Political Conditions

# What is ERP and what is the system and the model #
	1. Order to Cash
	2. Procure to Pay
	3. Plan to Produce
	4. Hire to Retire
	5. Environment and Circular Economy
